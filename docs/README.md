# OctoAcme Project Processes — Overview

Purpose
OctoAcme's project processes centralize how we initiate, plan, execute, and learn from work so teams can deliver predictable, high‑value outcomes. These practices make decisions, responsibilities, and artifacts discoverable for new teammates and stakeholders.

Key artifacts
- Project One‑pager: problem, goal, and success metrics (see octoacme-project-initiation.md)
- Backlog & Release plan: prioritized work and milestones (see octoacme-project-planning.md)
- Definition of Done (DoD) & Acceptance Criteria: entry/exit criteria for work
- Risk Register: tracked risks, owners, and mitigations (see octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)
- Release notes & rollback plan: for safe production changes (see octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)

Core roles
- Project Manager (PM): coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications.
- Product Manager (PdM): defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- Developers: implement features, tests, and documentation.
- QA/Testing: validate quality against acceptance criteria.
(See octoacme-roles-and-personas.md for details.)

Team rhythm
- Daily standups (short): surface progress and blockers.
- Weekly delivery sync: status, dependencies, and risks.
- End-of-sprint demos and retrospectives: show work and capture improvements (see octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md).

High-level lifecycle
1. Initiation — validate problem, stakeholders, one‑pager.
2. Planning — build backlog, estimates, DoD, and release plan.
3. Execution — iterate: small PRs, CI, reviews, QA.
4. Release — smoke tests, deploy, and announce.
5. Close & Learn — retrospective and update artifacts.
