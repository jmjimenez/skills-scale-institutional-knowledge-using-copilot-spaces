# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

## Purpose

The OctoAcme project management processes provide a structured approach to delivering cross-functional projects that create customer value. These processes help new team members quickly understand how OctoAcme runs projects, clarify roles and responsibilities, and ensure consistent delivery practices across all product features, services, and integrations.

## Core Principles

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five foundational principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead accountable for success
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence and metrics
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage open feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

## Core Roles

### Project Manager (PM)
Coordinates delivery activities, manages schedules, risks, and communications. Key responsibilities include creating project plans, managing dependencies, facilitating meetings (kickoff, planning, retrospectives), and ensuring consistent project documentation and status reporting.

### Product Manager (PdM)
Defines what should be built to deliver customer and business value. Owns the product vision, prioritizes the roadmap and backlog, collaborates with stakeholders on trade-offs, and validates solutions through user research and metrics.

### Developers
Design, build, test, and deliver software components. Implement features to meet acceptance criteria, write and maintain tests and documentation, participate in design and code reviews, and help identify technical risks.

### QA/Testing
Validate quality and acceptance criteria through unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests, and manual QA when needed.

### Stakeholders
Provide inputs, approvals, and feedback throughout the project lifecycle.

## Process Lifecycle

### 1. Initiation
**Goal**: Validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

**Key activities**:
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders and champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Create Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Decide go/no-go for planning

### 2. Planning
**Goal**: Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog.

**Key activities**:
- Hold kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
- Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
- Estimate scope and define Definition of Done
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Create release plan and milestone map

### 3. Execution & Tracking
**Goal**: Manage day-to-day execution and track progress toward milestones.

**Key activities**:
- Daily standups (15 min) focusing on progress, blockers, and dependencies
- Weekly delivery syncs to show progress and flag risks
- Use project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done)
- Pull Request workflow with automated tests and code reviews
- Track velocity, burndown, and success metrics

### 4. Release & Deployment
**Goal**: Release features to production safely with reduced risk.

**Key activities**:
- Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- Run CI/CD pipeline and security scans
- Draft release notes
- Deploy to staging and run smoke tests
- Deploy to production and run post-deploy verifications
- Announce release to stakeholders

### 5. Close & Retrospective
**Goal**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

**Key activities**:
- Review what went well and what could be improved
- Create 2-3 prioritized action items with owners and due dates
- Follow up on previous action items
- Celebrate successes and measure impact of improvements

## Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, OctoAcme teams produce and maintain these core artifacts:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement, goal, success metrics, stakeholders, and timeline
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: High-level timeline and milestone map
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria and estimates
- **Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done**: Clear standards for feature completion
- **Risk Register**: ID, description, impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation plan, and status
- **Retrospective notes and action items**: Learnings and improvements from each iteration
- **Release Notes**: Summary of changes, migration steps, and known issues

## Communication Cadence

OctoAcme follows a regular communication rhythm to maintain alignment and transparency:

- **Daily standups**: 15-minute team syncs (or as agreed) focusing on progress and blockers
- **Weekly PM + PdM sync**: Alignment on priorities, risks, and decisions
- **Weekly delivery sync**: Progress updates and flagged risks with the team
- **Sprint demos/reviews**: End of each sprint or milestone to showcase progress
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Status reports for broader stakeholder groups
- **Ad-hoc escalations**: As needed for critical blockers or incidents

### Escalation Paths
- Level 1: Team-level triage in daily standup
- Level 2: PM escalates to Product Lead and dependent teams
- Level 3: Sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues
