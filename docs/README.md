# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

## Summary

This README provides an overview of the core project management processes followed by OctoAcme, supporting effective planning, execution, release, risk management, and continuous improvement. These documents serve as institutional knowledge, helping new and existing team members understand how OctoAcme runs projects, defines roles, and maintains quality throughout the software development lifecycle. The processes outlined here align with the Program structure described in the main repository and are designed to scale institutional knowledge using Copilot Spaces.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on the following principles and practices:

**Core Principles:**
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning across all team levels

**Core Stages:**
1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Scope resources, set milestones, and map dependencies
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, review, and iterate with regular progress monitoring
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and announce to stakeholders
5. **Risk Management & Communication**: Maintain risk registers, coordinate cross-team communication, and provide regular status updates
6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings, identify action items, and apply insights to future projects

**Key Roles:**
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, requirements, and approvals
